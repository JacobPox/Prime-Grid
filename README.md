# Prime Grid

This Python script generates a square grid with a given size and fills in black squares if the number is prime at that location.

## To Use

Clone repository and run the script in its location.

The program will prompt you about the size of grid you want to use (must be a perfect square) Example: 16

Then you'll be asked if you want numbers displayed on the prime number. "Y" for yes, "N" for no. WARNING: If you are creating very large grids, it will slow down from displaying numbers.
